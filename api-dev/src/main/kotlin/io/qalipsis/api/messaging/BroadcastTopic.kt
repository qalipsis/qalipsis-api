/**
 * This class provides an implementation of [Topic] that forwards all the messages to all the subscriber.
 * Contrary to [BroadcastTopic], the new subscribers first receive all the records buffered so far.
 *
 * The implementation has a cost to consider, since it requires more processing to maintain thread-safety and buffering.
 *
 * @param idleTimeout idle time of a subscription: once a subscription passed this duration without record, it is cancelled.
 * @param maximalTopicSize maximal size of the topic: earliest records are discarded first.
